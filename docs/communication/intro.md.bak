External services will communicate with API gateway synchronously and will follow the request - response cycle.
 ### <Highlight color="#F0F8FF">Microservices communication</Highlight>
 Communication between microservices could either be synchronous or asynchronous. All synchronous communication will happen , either through HTTP or gRPC, via the service mesh (using proxy sidecar). Asynchronous communication will follow event driven architecture (EDA) through messages/events. The event format will follow the CloudEvents specification (a standard open format.

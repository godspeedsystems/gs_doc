The configuration variables as well as their values are defined in yaml files under `config/` directory. These variables can be replaced as per the business use cases. The default directory structure is given as below:

```
├── config
│   ├── custom-environment-variables.yaml
│   ├── default.yaml
```

The configuration files under `config/` directory can have specific naming conventions and load order. Please refer [File Name and Load Order](https://github.com/node-config/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files#file-load-order) for more information.

title: Scaffolding & structure of data config settings
---

# Introduction

The data related settings of any project are all contained in `config/data` folder, in a nested hierarchy.
The configLoader of GS_data reads the config/data path and loads all the configurations in a JSON for use by the `gs_data` module.

## Folder location

The data config folder is located within `config` folder of the project, just like all other configurations like exports, telemetry.

```
.                   //Project root
    ./src
        ./actions   //This will contain all the API contracts defined in this project by developer (For API schema driven development)
    ./config
        ./exports   //The exported functions from ../src or imported modules
        ./data      //Here will lie the data specific configurations read by the GS_data module.
        ./telemetry
        ...         //So on and so forth for other modules
```

## Folder structure

The folder will contain the following information in heirarchy

```
    ./config/data
        index.(yaml | toml | json)                  //For common fields like supportedLanguages, defaultPrimaryDB, requestTimeout etc.
        ./schema
            ./entities
                entityA.(yaml | toml)
                entityB.(yaml | toml)
            ./relationships
                definitions.yaml | definitions.toml | definitions.gsl
                ./definitions                               // Alternatively from above line
                    `${entityA} <> ${entityB}`.(gsl | yaml) // Keep all the relationships aggregated by the two entities.
                dataDependencies.gsl                        // All automatically aggregated fields with functions like union, copy and in future (average, max, min).
                denormalization.gsl                         // Copy of current elasticgraph's joins/index.txt
        ./performance
            ./batching //Or batching.yaml containing batch size and timeouts for different DBs of each kind
                elasticsearch.yaml
                postgres.yaml
                mongodb.yaml
        ./databases //Database settings
            elasticsearch.(yaml | toml)
            mongodb.(yaml | toml)
            postgres.(yaml | toml)
        ./environments
            dev.env
            staginv.env
            production.env
```

## Environment variables

There will also be variables definable in environment files, i.e. dev.env, staging.env and production.env files.
These files will have some predefined variables, some empty variables. They will get their data replaced/filled by devops process as per the business use case.
